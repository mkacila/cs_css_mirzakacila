	<h2>Personal information:</h2>

	<h3>Birth:</h3>
	<p>I was born in Sweeden in a little town called Uppsala on <b>January 2nd 1997</b>. Before I was even 2 years old we came back to Bosnia and Herzegovinia, right at the start of 1998.
	</p>
	<h3>Elementary school:</h3>
	<p>As soon as i truned 6 I starded attending elementary school. It was the school near my house called <a href="http://www.oskovacici.edu.ba/"><i>O.Š. Kovačići </i></a> wehre I spent the next 8 years preparing for my highschool education. In elementary school I was the playmaker of a Basketball team where. Other then sports I was also 2nd place in municipal competition in phisics.</p>
	<h3>Highschool:</h3>
	<p>Since I was good student at the elementary school I had good chances to enroll one of the best highshools in <a href="http://www.bosnjackagim.edu.ba/"><i>Sarajevo Prva Bošnjačka gimnazija</i></a>,wehre i spent the next 4 years. I countinued my basketball training in the highschool.</p>
	<h3>University:</h3>
	<p>Since I was a kid I got interested in computers and everything that had to do with them, so I decidet thats what I want to study for and work. Therefore I enrelled the <a href ="http://www.pmf.unsa.ba/"><i>Prirodno Matematički Fakultet u Sarajevu</i></a>. I went there for a year before I realised its not that computer science oriented, so I decided to search for the best university for computer science and software engeneering in and near Sarajevo. The next year I applied for the scholarship at the<a href="https://www.ius.edu.ba/" ><i>International Universiti of Sarajevo</i></a> and started my study there. Im third year now and very satisfied with the educating system and proffesors at the university. </p>
